Hey there ðŸ‘‹
<br>
<br>
My name is Aditya, and I am currently working on releasing v1.0 for ForgeðŸ”¥ <br>
<br>
It's a work in progress, and I'm actively building and refining its functionalities. I'll be pushing updates and improvements to this repository regularly. Feel free to watch this repository to stay updated on the project's progress! <br>
<br>
I welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you'd like to report bugs, suggest features, or collaborate on the codebase, feel free to open issues or pull requests. <br>
<br>
I am a passionate FOSS enthusiast, a Linux user (I use Fedora btw)
<br>
<br>
And I am currently learning Rails
